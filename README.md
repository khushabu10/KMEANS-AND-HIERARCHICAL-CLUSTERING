# KMEANS-AND-HIERARCHICAL-CLUSTERING
Perform cluster analysis utilizing hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering.
Perform the assigned clustering algorithm on the seven attributes (ignore the first attribute Sex withvalues of M, F and I). This attribute will be used to explore the quality of your clustering approach.
Once the clustering is done, evaluate its quality by comparing each abalone in each cluster to that datapoint/abalone first attribute value. Depending on the percentage of similar data points in each cluster, the naturalgrouping of clustering coincides with the actual observations recorded in the data set.
For example: Cluster 1 â€“ data point 100, 103, 50, 60, etc. Of these, three abalone are labeled as M and one as I. So,yourcluster is 75% pure. The remaining 15% are from the I category.
Depending on the purity of your clusters, utilize clustering with fewer or more clusters (k for k-means). Again,evaluate the purity of the clusters and makeconclusion on whether the observed data set conforms well to theexpected three categories of individuals.
The clustering approaches must be coded in Python. The report must contain analysis of all experiments.
# Requirements:
Clustering with various algorithm parameters (k for k-means)
Analysis of results, meanings and data set conclusions
Jupyter Notebook Markdown or Code
